            <h3 className="text-fluid-md mb-fluid-3">Policies to Prevent Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking</h3>
            <p className="text-justify mb-fluid-3">
              Given the nature of its business, Geria has comparatively limited procurement activities (talent acquisition aside). Nevertheless, the company takes a robust approach to determine which suppliers it contracts with and is not prepared to maintain business relations with any supplier found to have committed, or been involved with, modern slavery, human trafficking, or forced labor abuses. Our opposition to modern slavery and human trafficking is codified in our Employee Handbook, which also provides for incident reporting, and reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to eliminate, as far as possible, the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking taking place anywhere in our business or supply chains.
            </p>
            <p className="text-justify mb-fluid-3">
              By way of example, steps we have taken to help ensure modern slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in our business or supply chain include:

                <span className='block mb-fluid-3'>Global Procurement Policy</span>
                <span className='block mb-fluid-3 text-justify'>We have a comprehensive procurement policy in place to regulate how we deal with our global suppliers in a well-managed, fair and ethical manner. This incorporates a strict employee code of conduct and whistleblowing procedure so that any malpractice can swiftly be dealt with and resolved. It also provides for an organized tracking system of vendors and periodic audits of vendor and procurement procedures to ensure compliance.</span></li>
              <li>
                <span className='block mb-fluid-3'>Vendor Code of Conduct</span>
                <span className='block mb-fluid-3 text-justify'>Our suppliers are contractually obligated to comply with our vendor code of conduct. This code requires compliance with local employment laws and diversity practices and expressly prohibits child labor, discriminatory treatment of workers, and other forms of modern slavery and forced labor or involuntary servitude.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className='block mb-fluid-3'>Adult Hiring Policy</span>
                <span className='block mb-fluid-3 text-justify'>Our adult hiring policy expressly prohibits the use of child labor, forced labor, and the exploitation of children in our global operations. Notwithstanding any local laws permitting employment at a lower age, Geria does not hire employees below the age of 18.</span>

            </ul>
            <p className="text-justify mb-fluid-3">
              Our compliance, audit, and legal teams are involved in ensuring this process works and will monitor it regularly, adapting as necessary to the changing needs of our business.

            <h3 className="text-fluid-md mb-fluid-3">Training</h3>
            <p className="text-justify mb-fluid-3">
              To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and in our supply chains, where appropriate, we will be asking our vendors to provide training to their staff and suppliers.
